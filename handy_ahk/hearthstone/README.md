## hs_packs.ahk

Download and install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

Compile hs_pack_opening.ahk using the freshly installed "Convert .ahk to .exe"

Run your new hs_packs.exe program

Nothing should happen at first, but now every time you press 'a' in a HS window it should produce an infinite string of spacebar inputs allowing you to open all your packs in a single keypress

Pressing 's' cancels this string and alerts you with a message box if 'a' is active

Otherwise 's' kills the script

Have a nice cup of tea while your packs open themselves :tea:
